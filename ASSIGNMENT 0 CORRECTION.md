Why is knowledge discovery known as Data Mining? This is because Data Mining is used to find or discover pattern and relationship of data in a
large dataset to acquire useful information. Therefore the discovered pattern become knowledge when they are interpreted , evaluated and used 
in decision making( The useful meaning gottten from that information is referred to Knowledge)

        - Knowledge is when a cook discover custom behaviour and decide to sell food with water to increase sales.

What is the different between Data Wragling, scanning and filtering in data mining:
Data Wragling : Its the process of cleaning , that involve converting raw data into usable format for a specific use. While
Data Filtering is the process of refining raw data by removing errors, reducing noise and eliminating data redundant in order to get the most 
useful information based on specific criteria from large data set. and,
Data Scanning , it involve use of software to search through files and dataset to identify and locate specific type of data, this include 
software like Apache Spark, Data brick, power BI and many more
