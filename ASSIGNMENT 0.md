why is knowledge discovery known as data mining? 
Knowledge discovery is widely called data mining because the data mining step—where algorithms find patterns—is the most important, visible, and exciting part of the entire knowledge discovery process.
Although KDD includes many stages (cleaning, selecting, transforming data, mining patterns, and presenting results), the pattern-extraction step became so dominant that people started using the shorter term “data mining” to describe the whole process.
Over time, companies, books, tools, and industry professionals popularized the term data mining, so even though academics still separate “KDD” and “data mining,” in everyday use data mining now refers to the entire process of discovering knowledge from data.


What is the Different between Data Wrangling, Scanning and Filtering in data mining?
Data wrangling is the big, detailed process of cleaning, fixing, restructuring, and improving the whole dataset so it is ready for analysis. It changes the data.

Scanning means looking at or summarizing the data to understand what is inside. It does not change the data. It happens during exploration and also inside many algorithms that “scan” through the data.

Filtering is a small, simple step that just keeps the rows or columns you need and removes the rest. It is usually just one part of data wrangling
